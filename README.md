Events-listing widget that calls (dev, for now) Catalog API.

Temporarily works out 'domain url' from IP address to run locally. This will eventually be replaced with actual domain.
Simulates third-party server by serving 'client' directory.

Directions for Testing:

1. clone repo
2. cd widgettest
3. npm init
4. npm install
5. node index.js
6. type search team in search bar on simulated client site
